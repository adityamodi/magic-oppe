# Implementation of MAGIC off-policy policy evaluation estimator for RL

This is the code submitted in lieu of the replication project for EECS 692; Advanced AI at Univ. of Michigan.
We replicate the results presented in the paper [Data-efficient Off-policy Policy Evaluation for Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00923) by Thomas et. al.
